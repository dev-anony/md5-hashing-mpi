# Parallel MD5 Hashing Tool with MPI

This is a C-based parallel MD5 hashing tool that uses **MPI (Message Passing Interface)** to distribute computation across multiple processes. It is designed for performance and portability using standard C libraries and a custom MD5 implementation.

## 🧾 Features

- Parallel computation using MPI
- Custom implementation of MD5 hashing
- Utilizes standard C libraries including `math.h`, `string.h`, etc.
- Written in pure C

## ⚙️ Requirements

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- MPI (e.g., OpenMPI or MPICH)
- Math library (`libm`)
- Custom MD5 header and implementation files (`md5.h` and `md5.c`)

### ✅ Install Dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

Compile the project using `mpicc`, the MPI C compiler wrapper:

```mpicc -o md5_tool main.c md5.c -lm
```

- `main.c`: Your main program using MPI and MD5.
- `md5.c`: The implementation of MD5 functions.
- `-lm`: Links the math library.
    
## ▶️ Run Instructions

Run the compiled executable using `mpirun` with the number of processes you want:

```mpirun -np 4 ./md5_tool
```

Replace `4` with the desired number of parallel processes.

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure that `md5.h` and `md5.c` are correctly implemented and accessible in your working directory.
- The `md5.h` file must declare all necessary functions used in `main.c`, and `md5.c` must define them.
